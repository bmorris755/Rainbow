1. General Idea 
    - Create code editor that has stack overflow integration.

2.  Target Audience
    - Developers who need or would like help from stack overflow.

3. Identify the problem that this will address
    - We want to minimize the time between having a coding question and getting an answer.

4. Primary goal of the project
    - Provide a mechanism by which programmers can get help on their code.

5. Identify and prioritize the user stories.
    - As a user I want to be able to type code into and editor so I can build in a sandboxed environment.
    - As a user I want to be able to search for coding questions when I'm stuck.
    - As a user I want to be able to see stack overflow answers that are relevant to my problem.
